# 🔄 DFA for Regular Expressions

A console-based C++ application that builds and simulates a "Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)" based on a given regular expression.  
The program reads the expression from a file, validates it, constructs the DFA, and allows users to test whether specific words are accepted by the automaton.
